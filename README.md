🖒 (module for Omeka S)
======================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[🖒] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows visitors to like or dislike resources
via a simple click on a button. The module supports five icon shape combinations:
heart (❤️/💔), thumb (👍/👎), reversed thumb (🖒/🖓), and mixed combinations (👍/🖓
or 🖒/👎). Heart is the default icon shape.


**About the name of the module**

The module is named "🖒" (Unicode character U+1F592, Reversed thumbs up sign).
The main purpose of this choice is to check current php version, web services,
browsers, graphical interfaces and operating systems with a real life feature.
In particular, most browsers bypass the right font character with specific icon.
And historically, the implementation of the unicode in php was complex and
caused the [fall of php 6].

Workarounds are included in the modules to make it working, except in some
non-friendly and anti-privacy systems. The aim is to remove them. Furthermore,
this module adds a useless feature of the web, so if it cannot be installed, it
can be skipped in most of the cases.

Note: The character 🖒 (U+1F592) differs from the more common 👍 (U+1F44D) in
order to force the orientation of the icon to be like common representation
(wrist on left) and integrate smoothly in the code (from left to right).
In fact, the choice of the right or left hand is not explicitely defined for
this icon, but the general recommandations is to be standard, so 90% of people
use right hand, so the right representation of U+1F44D should be right hand. And
this is the choice of most fonts and font-designers. Nevertheless, some dominant
companies that don't care about people and standards that are not theirs, chose
to use left hand, so it is the most common mental representation of users now.

Anyway, an option allows to specify any of the unicode symbol in the module.
Default is ❤.


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

The module requires the modules [Common], version 3.4.74 or later, and [Guest],
version 3.4.11 or later.

* From the zip

Download the last release [🖒.zip] from the list of releases, and
uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `🖒`, go to the root of the module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```

* For test

The module includes a test suite with unit and functional tests.
Run them from the root of Omeka:

```sh
vendor/bin/phpunit -c modules/🖒/test/phpunit.xml --testdox
```


Quick Start
-----------

After installation:

1. Configure the module in the admin settings to enable likes on desired
   resource types (items, item sets, media).
2. Configure the display options:
   - Icon shape: heart (default), thumb (👍/👎), reversed thumb (🖒/🖓),
     or mixed combinations (👍/🖓, 🖒/👎)
   - Icon type: Unicode (emoji) or Font Awesome
   - Allow dislike: disabled by default
   - Allow users to change their vote: enabled by default
   - Show/hide like and dislike counts
3. Add the "🖒: Button" resource page block to your site resource page templates.
4. Authenticated users can now like (and optionally dislike) resources.


Development / themes
--------------------

### View Helper

The `🖒()` view helper can be used in themes:

```php
// Basic usage - uses current resource and user from view
echo $this->🖒();

// With specific resource
echo $this->🖒($resource);

// With options
echo $this->🖒($resource, null, [
    'showCount🖒' => true,
    'showCount🖓' => false,
    // 'heart', 'thumb', 'reverse', 'thumb-reverse', or 'reverse-thumb'
    'iconShape' => 'heart',
    // 'unicode' or 'fa'
    'iconType' => 'unicode',
    'allow🖓' => false,
    // Allow users to change/remove their vote
    'allowChangeVote' => true,
    // Custom template
    'template' => 'common/🖒',
]);
```

### Sort

Resources can be sorted by like counts using API parameters:

- `sort_by=like_count` - Sort by number of likes
- `sort_by=dislike_count` - Sort by number of dislikes
- `sort_by=vote_count` - Sort by total votes


Guest Integration
-----------------

When the [Guest] module is installed, users can access their liked resources at
`/s/my-site/guest/like`. A widget is automatically added to the guest dashboard
showing the user's likes count.

You can also add a "My Likes" link to your site navigation using the navigation
link type "My Likes".

### Site Settings for Guest

The following site settings are available to customize the guest experience:

- Guest widget label: Label shown in the guest dashboard widget (default: "Likes")
- Guest link label: Label for the link in the widget, use %d for count (default:
  "My likes (%d)")
- Guest page title: Title of the guest likes page (default: "My Likes")


TODO
----

- [ ] Add like notifications
- [ ] Add like reports/statistics
- [ ] Add a way to allow anonymous like (one time only)


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.

```sh
# database dump example
mariadb-dump -u omeka -p omeka | gzip > "omeka.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql.gz"
```
